// configCmd represents the config command
var configCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "config",
	Short: "Management of Ontrack configurations",
	Long: `The 'config' command allows you to manage the connections to remote Ontrack instances
in different configurations, and to reuse them.

By default, no configuration is present, and you need to create one. For example, to create
a 'local' configuration to connect to a local instance of Ontrack using a username and a password:

	ontrack-cli config create local http://localhost:8080 --username <username> --password <password>
	
or to create a 'prod' configuration using a token:

	ontrack-cli config create prod https://ontrack.nemerosa.net --token <token>

When a configuration is created, it is used as a default. You can select another configuration by using:

	ontrack-cli config select prod

and you can get the list of configurations using:

	ontrack-cli config list

Use 'ontrack-cli config' to see the other options.

	// Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {},
}

	rootCmd.AddCommand(configCmd)

	// Here you will define your flags and configuration settings.

	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	// configCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	// configCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
}
